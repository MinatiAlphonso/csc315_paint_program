* Code compiles
* Code runs and brings up a window
* At least some of the palette is being drawn
* The palette behaves correctly when the window is resized
* All team members show repository activity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

   * For the second checkpoint, all of the first checkpoint's items must be
     maintained (i.e. no regressions).  Modifications to the first checkpoint's
     items are:

        * Code compiles without warnings using compiler flag -Wall
        * Code runs and brings up a window and does not leak memory for this
          sequence:  Run, bring up window, exit by pressing ESC key
        * All members show repository activity and the repository is in good
          order (i.e. no binary files, good commit messages)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint 1:  5%/5%  [git checkout 4a358afdf79]

  * Good job getting after this early.  Keep it up.

  * Window resizes smoothly

  * So far so good.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint 2:    5%/5%  [git checkout 6e5f6e03b48]

* All requirements of the first checkpoint (no regressions)
* Full palette displayed
+ Source has documented function headers
* Can select border and fill colors
* Can draw (at least) a single shape with (above) border and fill color


   * Why did you remove the Score sheet?

   * Still some work to do.  Selecting a tool erases part of the palette
  
   * Square is drawn with selected color but can not be sized.

   * Shapes disappear when window is resized

   * Good balance in the repo activity

   * Inconsistent indentation and vertical whitespacing

   * Fairly consistent effort.  Keep it up, don't leave things until the
     last day or so.
